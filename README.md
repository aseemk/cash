# Cash (WIP)

CoffeeScript shell language. Like Bash, but Cash.

Bash (like most other shell languages) is fantastic at working with files and
processes. It (like most other shell languages) sucks in most other language
features, particularly syntax and control flow.

CoffeeScript is a fantastic language (better than most other high-level
programming languages), particularly in syntax and control flow. It (like most
other high-level programming languages) sucks at working with files and
processes. [1]

We can't change the language features of Bash, but we can add convenience APIs
to CoffeeScript. And thus, Cash was born.

This is a work in progress, starting from scratch. Follow along, submit your
feature ideas, contribute code, or just spread the word.
